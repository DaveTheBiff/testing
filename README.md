My internship project for December 2025:

A simple command-line application (CLI) for tracking personal income and expenses. This project is a great example of using Python dictionaries for storing structured data and applying strict type hinting for clean, reliable code.


What this project has to offer:
    
    Add Transactions: Record new financial entries (income or expense) with details like category and description.
    
    View Ledger: Display a chronological list of all recorded transactions.
    
    Summary: Calculate the overall financial standing: total income, total expenses, and the net balance.
    
    Structured Data: Uses Python lists of dictionaries to hold the financial records.
    
    Code Clarity: Implemented with detailed Python type hints (List, Dict, Literal) to define data structures clearly.
